Add a unique live social media preview to your web pages. Free for small sites.

== Description ==

Use our simple plugin to display aesthetic thumbnails of your web presence on social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram and co.).
Every time a user shares a URL of your website, an updated screenshot will be displayed.
The rendering of the screenshot is performed by our Screenshot Cluster, which supports all current web technologies.
This ensures consistent quality and response time for social media crawler queries.

Features:

*   Creates automatic live thumbnails of your pages, which will be displayed in social media.
*   Custom thumbnail caching


This plugin uses technology of [screenshot-capture-api.com](https://screenshot-capture-api.com/) that requires prior [registration](https://screenshot-capture-api.com/signup-cover).
